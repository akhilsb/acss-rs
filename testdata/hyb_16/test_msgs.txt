In the vast expanse of the universe, neutron stars stand as some of the most enigmatic and extreme objects known to science. These celestial remnants, born from the explosive deaths of massive stars, are so dense that a single sugar-cube-sized piece of their material would weigh as much as a mountain on Earth. Spinning rapidly, some of them emit beams of radiation that sweep through space like cosmic lighthouses, earning them the name pulsars. Despite their small size—just about 20 kilometers in diameter—their gravity is so intense that it warps space and time around them. They are a reminder of the universe’s incredible capacity to compress, transform, and recycle matter in ways that stretch the limits of imagination.
